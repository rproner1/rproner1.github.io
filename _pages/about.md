Hello and welcome to my website! I have just completed my Bachelor of Commerce in economics and finance from the University of Guelph. Beginning in August of this year I will be a graduate student studying economics at Western University located in London, ON. After the completion of my MA, I plan on continuing my education and training with a PhD in economics or finance. My research interests include applications of machine learning in asset pricing and macroeconomic time series forecasting.
