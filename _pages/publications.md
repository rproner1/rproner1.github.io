**Proner, R. A Multi-Task Deep Learning Model for Inflation Forecasting: Dynamic Phillips Curve Neural Network**
Price stability is essential to economic development and high inflation can be harmful to vulnerable segments of the population. However, forecasting inflation has been difficult for central banks in the past due to the abundance of shocks and the complexities of business cycle transitions. To address this, I propose the Dynamic Phillips Curve Neural Network (DPCNN), a multi-task deep learning model which incorporates longterm business cycle dynamics using long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. DPCNN simultaneously forecasts inflation and the unemployment rate, which improves out-ofsample performance by imposing an economic constraint on their joint dynamics and produces a forward looking Phillips Curve. I show DPCNN provides significant advantages over time-series econometric models and off-the-shelf machine learning models.

**Proner, R. and Liu, F. Factor Timing with Deep Learning**
Factors in the cross-section of stocks are persistent sources of risk premia (Fama, E. F. and French, K. R. 1993), forming the basis for factor investing. Factors such as size and value deliver high returns over the long run, but can underperform in the short run, creating the scope for investors to engage in factor timing. We develop a dynamic multi-task neural network (DMT) for the simultaneous timing of several factors, while imposing several economically motivated constraints with the model architecture. We show that DMT is more accurate on average and provides significant gains in excess returns over the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy and other state-of-the-art machine learning methods.
